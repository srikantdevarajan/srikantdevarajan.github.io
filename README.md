I prefered Skeleton over Bootstrap for this project mainly because it allowed me to get a responsive grid and set the styling myself. Bootstrap tends to force its own styling and padding which I did not want. Skeleton did the job.

Animations are done using animate.css and css's basic transitions and :hover property.
